# Subway Accident Database System

This is an academic project done by myself last year, including some basic database functions such as query, inserting data and so on.

It's built on MyEclipse, so there are some configuration files MyEclipse created automatically.

The whole project used these 3rd-party libraries:

1. SSH(Spring, Struts, Hibernate) framework.
2. Apache POI, to operate Microsoft Word files.
3. Baidu ECharts, to create charts based on data.
